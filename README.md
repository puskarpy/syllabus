# Intro

This is a simple project that displays the syllabuses of all subjects of Computer Engineering. I just brought all the syllabus together and put it together in a place.

## Tech Stack
- React + Tailwind
- PDFs are currently hosted on Github.

## Feautres
- Syllabus are in PDF format.
- PDFs can be viewed, edited and downloaded.
- PDFs are organized by semester and subjects.

## Improvements
- Some syllabuses are still missing, I will be adding those once I get them
- I am also planning on adding Past Question papers in the future.
